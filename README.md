## Liam Mazure

* I enjoy doing triathlons and am currently training for the Detroit Marathon.
* I would love to learn how to work with a rasberry pi.
* I enjoy reading and practice the habbit every night before bed.

### Technical Background

I have experience programming more in depth in both Java and Python.
I have also worked with C and SQL.
I am looking to explore any other technology that I happen to run into along my journey.
